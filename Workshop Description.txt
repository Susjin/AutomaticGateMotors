description=[h2][b]How to use it?:[/b][/h2]
description=[olist]
description=[*] Find the magazine "All about Automatic Gates" to learn the recipes and how to install the motor.
description=[*] Craft a Automatic Gate Motor and a Automatic Gate Controller
description=[*] Install the Motor on a gate using a Propane Torch and Welding Rods (Option only shows if you read the magazine and have a Propane Torch and a Welder Mask)
description=[*] You can connect the Controller to the Automatic Gate to use it
description=[*] To open/close, the gate needs any car battery inside it's new compartment (corner part).
description=[*] The gate can also be locked/unlocked (automatically/manually) using a Controller (automation part can be changed via [i]Sandbox Settings[/i])
description=[/olist]
description=This should be everything you need to know to use get around how to use the mod.
description=If you want to know more and don't care about spoilers, I recommend you read the full [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com]List of Features[/url][/i]
description=
description=[h3][b]BE CAREFUL![/b][/h3]
description=If the gate is locked, you cannot connect another controller directly to it. 
description=So, if you have no controllers connected to a gate, and it is locked, the only solution is to [b][i]DESTROY[/i][/b] the gate and build a new one.
description=This is done for security reasons (MP). If you have a idea on how to do it better, see pinned discussion [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com]Suggestions[/url][/i].
